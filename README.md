This project restores old face photos using AI. Watch the [4 minute explainer video](https://twitter.com/nutlope/status/1614794731396931585) to see how I built this or see the [15 second demo](https://twitter.com/nutlope/status/1612488923716136962).

## How it works

It uses an ML model from the Applied Research Center called [GFPGAN](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN) on [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) to restore face photos. This application gives you the ability to upload any photo, which will send it through this ML Model using a Next.js API route, and return your restored photo.

## Running Locally

After cloning the repo, go to [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) to make an account and put your API key in a file called `.env`. If you'd also like to do rate limiting, create an account on UpStash, create a Redis database, and populate the two environment variables in `.env` as well. If you don't want to do rate limiting, you don't need to make any changes.

Then, run the application in the command line and it will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
npm run dev
```
